Strategy Definition: You create a Local Strategy class that extends the PassportStrategy from @nestjs/passport. This class typically includes a validate method where you'll define the logic for checking the user's credentials against a database.

Guard Implementation: You implement a guard, typically named LocalAuthGuard, that extends NestJS's AuthGuard and specifies the Local Strategy. This guard is responsible for handling requests to your routes that require authentication, 
ensuring that only authenticated users can access these routes.

Request Flow: When a request hits a protected route (e.g., a login route), the LocalAuthGuard is triggered. It extracts the credentials from the request and invokes the validate method of the Local Strategy to verify the user's credentials.

User Retrieval: If the credentials are valid, the Local Strategy returns the user object, which is then attached to the request object as req.user. If the credentials are invalid, an Unauthorized exception is thrown.

Further Processing: Once the user is authenticated and the user object is attached to the request, you can access it in your controller method to handle further application logic, such as generating JWT tokens or setting user sessions.
